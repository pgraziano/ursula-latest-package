# plugin code that is using the Nova CLI could break since by default the CLI
# does version negotation and requests the latest microversion available from
# the server based on the latest version that the client currently supports,
# which could change request/response semantics. This is why we pin to the
# the v2.0 API (which is deprecated) until they are brought current.
